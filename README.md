# Movie Recommendation System using Cosine Similarity

This project implements a movie recommendation system based on cosine similarity. Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity between two vectors by calculating the cosine of the angle between them. In the context of movie recommendation, it helps identify movies that are similar to each other based on user ratings.

## Introduction

The movie recommendation system utilizes cosine similarity to recommend movies to users based on their preferences. By analyzing the similarity between movies in a high-dimensional space, the system suggests relevant movies that users are likely to enjoy.

## Key Features

### Cosine Similarity
The recommendation system computes cosine similarity scores between movies to identify those with similar characteristics or user preferences.

### User Ratings
The system leverages user ratings to generate personalized recommendations, taking into account individual preferences and tastes.

### Movie Database
A comprehensive movie database is used as the basis for recommendation, containing information such as movie titles, genres, and user ratings.

### Scalability
The system is designed to scale efficiently with a growing number of users and movies, ensuring fast and accurate recommendations even with large datasets.

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the movie dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Cosine Similarity Calculation**: Compute cosine similarity scores between movies based on user ratings.

3. **Recommendation Generation**: For a given user, recommend movies with the highest cosine similarity scores to those they have already rated positively.
